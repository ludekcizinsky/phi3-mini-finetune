\section{Appendix}
\label{sec:appendix}

% If you wish, you can include an appendix, which should be part of the main PDF, and does not count towards the page limit. Appendices can be useful to supply extra details, examples, figures, results, visualizations, etc., that you couldnâ€™t fit into the main paper. However, your grader does not have to read your appendix, and you should assume that you will be graded based on the content of the main part of your paper only.

\subsection{AI Usage}

Throughout the project, we used Github Copilot and ChatGPT to assist with both
coding and writing.  Copilot is automatically prompted within the IDE and
ChatGPT was prompted using the OpenAI website.  In general, when coding, Copilot
was used to generate code snippets and functions to save time.  When writing,
copilot suggested sentences and paragraphs to help with the writing process. 

However, all output was verified manually by ourselves. When coding, all outputs
were re-read, and often the suggestions are not helpful unless the code is
laborious and simple.  For writing, we reworked almost every suggestion to fit
the context of the report and for greater consistency. 

We found that for simple Python notebooks or specific library functions, Copilot
was very helpful.  However, for more complex code or writing, it was often
incorrect and required more manual work.  When writing, ChatGPT was helpful for
suggesting sentences and paragraphs, but many of these suggestions are incorrect
or not relevant.  It was most useful for generating a list of ideas for a given
section from which we could then write the content ourselves.
