    The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has impacted education forever,
    with models becoming integral tools in aiding students' learning.  However,
    even advanced models can struggle to provide accurate answers to complex
    questions typical in STEM university curricula. Motivated by these
    challenges, we align an open-source LLM with a curated preference dataset
    collected by EPFL students, and enhance the model's performance on
    multiple-choice question answering by fine-tuning. Additionally, we quantise
    our best performing model to 4-bit precision. Our findings indicate that we
    successfully aligned our model, achieving 67\% accuracy in predicting the
    preferred answers. However, despite extensive fine-tuning, we did not
    observe improvements compared to our base model. Finally, we successfully
    quantised the model to 4-bit precision with minimal loss in performance.
