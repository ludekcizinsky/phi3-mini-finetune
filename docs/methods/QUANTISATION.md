## Quantisation

The goal of quantisation is to reduce the model size while sacricifing minimally the performance of the model. We are guiding our quantisation process according to the HF's [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/quantization#transformers.GPTQConfig). You can read a detailed summary of the GPTQ paper [here](gptq_summary.pdf).
